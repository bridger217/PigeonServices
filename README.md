iOS App I made for my gf. It's a personalized memories app that sends her a notification every day displaying a new image. It uses
- A js script to caption and upload images to firebase
- A firestore collection of images/captions
- Cloud scheduler function that updates "today's image"
- OneSignal push notifications
- Swift FE

Here's a video of me making it https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTL6G4gt8/
